review unavailable alice --remove
```

### `review version`
Display version information about the tool, including:
- Current version number
- Tool description
- Node.js version
- Platform information

## Configuration

The tool uses a `.pr-reviewer.yml` file in your repository root:

```yaml
# Team members eligible for review
team:
  - alice
  - bob
  - charlie
  - david

# Excluded users (bots, external contributors)
excluded:
  - dependabot[bot]
  - github-actions[bot]

# Configuration settings
lookbackPRs: 30         # Number of recent PRs to analyze for approval patterns
maxPendingReviews: 3    # Max pending reviews before reviewer is deprioritized


# Unavailable team members
unavailable:
  alice:
    since: "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
    until: "2024-01-20T10:00:00Z"
```

## Selection Algorithm

The tool uses a simple, transparent algorithm focused on minimizing repeats and load balancing approvals:

1. **Looks at the last N PRs** (default: 30) to see who has been approving recently
2. **Prioritizes reviewers with fewer recent approvals** - if someone hasn't approved any of the last 30 PRs, they get top priority
3. **Breaks ties by recency** - among reviewers with the same approval count, picks who approved longest ago
4. **Considers current workload** - adds penalty for pending reviews, heavy penalty for exceeding max pending reviews

This simple approach ensures fair rotation of approvals (not just comments) and prevents the same people from always being selected while others are skipped.

## Development

```bash
# Run tests
