## Commands

- Create `.pr-reviewer.yml` configuration file
- Set up scoring weights and preferences

### `review elect [options]`

Options:
- `-p, --pr <number>`: PR number to elect reviewer for (defaults to current branch's PR)
- `-a, --auto-assign`: Automatically assign the elected reviewer

```bash
# Elect for current branch's PR
review elect

# Elect for specific PR and auto-assign
review elect --pr 123 --auto-assign
```

### `review stats [options]`
Display review statistics for the team.

Options:
- `-d, --days <number>`: Number of days to show stats for (default: 30)

```bash
# Show stats for last 30 days

### `review next [options]`
Show who's next in line for review without making any changes.

Options:
- `-n, --count <number>`: Number of reviewers to show (default: 3)

### `review unavailable <username> [options]`
Mark a team member as unavailable.

Options:
- `-u, --until <date>`: Date until unavailable (YYYY-MM-DD)

```bash
# Mark someone unavailable until a date
review unavailable alice --until 2024-12-25

# Mark someone unavailable indefinitely
review unavailable bob

# Mark someone as available again
review unavailable alice --remove
```

## Configuration

The tool uses a `.pr-reviewer.yml` file in your repository root:

```yaml
# Team members eligible for review
team:
  - alice
  - bob
  - charlie
  - david

# Excluded users (bots, external contributors)
excluded:
  - dependabot[bot]
  - github-actions[bot]

# Scoring weights
weights:
  recency: 3      # Days since last review
  balance: 2      # Review count balance
  workload: 1     # Current pending reviews

# Review history window (days)
historyDays: 30

# Maximum pending reviews before deprioritizing
maxPendingReviews: 3

# Unavailable team members
unavailable:
  alice:
    since: "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
    until: "2024-01-20T10:00:00Z"
```

## Scoring Algorithm

The tool uses a weighted scoring system to select reviewers:

1. **Recency** (highest weight): Prefers reviewers who haven't reviewed in the longest time
2. **Balance**: Distributes reviews evenly across the team
3. **Workload**: Deprioritizes reviewers with many pending reviews

Score = (Days Since Last Review √ó Recency Weight) + (Average Reviews - Reviewer Count √ó Balance Weight) - (Pending Reviews √ó Workload Weight)

## Development

```bash
